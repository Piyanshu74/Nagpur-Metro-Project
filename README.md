# Nagpur-Metro-Project


This is a CPP project that will take source and destination from the user and display the shortest distance and time required to reach the metro station.

It is implemented using Graph, Heap and Hashmap data structure. The graph has nodes and edges. Nodes represent metro stations and edges represent distance or time between two connecting stations.

By using Dijkstras algorithm shortest path between source and destination is found and accordingly distance and time are displayed.

main.cpp contains the major code and graph.cpp contains Graph implementation.
